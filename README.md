# Meria Home Test

## Intro

This project has been created and is running with Expo. More informations here -> [Expo doc](https://docs.expo.dev/)

The app is running thanks to theses amazing packages:

- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) (state management)
- [Redux-sage](https://redux-saga.js.org/) (side effect manager)
- [MirageJS](https://miragejs.com/) (API mock)
- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/) (css)

## How to run

1. First intall all dependencies

 ```bash
   $ npm ci
   ```

2. Run the app

 ```bash
   $ npm run start
   ```

3. Then, in the console prompt, chose your device (a for Android, i for IOS).
4. You can also download the ExpoGO app on your physical device and scan the QR code generated by the ``npm run start``
   command. This will open the app directly on your device. :rocket:

## Tools

I added some tools to check the code quality before merging

```bash
$ npm run lint  #check the conde syntax
```

```bash
$ npm run lint:fix  #check the conde syntax and fix errors founds
```

```bash
$ npm run checktyp  #run tsc command to check your project type
```

```bash
$ npm run check-ci  #will run typecheck, linter and prettier
```

Thanks !
